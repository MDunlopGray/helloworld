Part of the intro to GIT course at the MITRE Institute
* Now I will try to add some bling using the MarkDown language

## firstly, this is a great image for my GIT repository:

# Now, and ordered list

1. list item number 1
2. list item immediately following list item number 1
3. list item somewhere down the line, not to be confused with the list item immediately following list item number 1

## and now for an unordered **list** with an unordered *sublist*

* this would be list item number 1 if this were *ordered*, but alas...
* another item, equally as disordered as above
 * does this make for a sub item?
  * how about this? a sub for the sub?

# Now, adding an image from the local folder
